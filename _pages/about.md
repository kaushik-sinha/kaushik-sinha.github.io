I am an Associate Professor in the School of Computing at Wichita State University. I enjoy solving problems related to theoretical and applied machine learning, optimization and algorithms. I also apply machine learning techniques to solve health/medical informatics problems. 

Before joining Wichita State, I spent two wonderful years in the Computer Science and Engineering department at University of California San Diego as a Postdoctoral Scholar. My mentors were [Sanjoy Dasgupta](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/) and [Kamalika Chaudhuri](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kamalika/).

I received my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from Ohio State University. My advisor was [Misha Belkin](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~belkin.8/).

I am an affiliated researcher at the Institute for Fundations of Machine Learning ([IFML](https://ml.utexas.edu/ifml)).
